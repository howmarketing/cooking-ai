STORY OF THE DOOR

MR.  Utterson  the  lawyer  was  a  man  of  a  rugged  countenance

that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed
in discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet
somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his
taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something
indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not
only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often
and loudly in the acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank
gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he
enjoyed the theater, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years.
But he had an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering,
almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their mis-
deeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. (cid:147)I
incline to Cain(cid:146)s heresy,(cid:148) he used to say quaintly: (cid:147)I let my brother go
to  the  devil  in  his  own way.(cid:148)  In  this  character,  it  was  frequently  his
fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influ-
ence in the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as
they came about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in
his  demeanour.

No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemon-
strative at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a
similar catholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to
accept his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity;
and that was the lawyer(cid:146)s way. His friends were those of his own blood
or those whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were
the growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no
doubt the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant
kinsman, the well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for
many,  what  these  two  could  see  in  each  other,  or  what  subject  they
could  find  in  common.  It  was  reported  by  those  who  encountered
them in their Sunday walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly
dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For
all that, the two men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted
them the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of

2

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

pleasure, but even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy
them  uninterrupted.

It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a
by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is
called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The inhab-
itants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to do
better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry; so
that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invi-
tation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it veiled
its  more  florid  charms  and  lay  comparatively  empty  of  passage,  the
street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a
forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and
general  cleanliness  and  gaiety  of  note,  instantly  caught  and  pleased
the eye of the passenger.

Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was
broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain sinister
block  of  building  thrust  forward  its  gable  on  the  street.  It  was  two
storeys  high;  showed  no  window,  nothing  but  a  door  on  the  lower
storey  and  a  blind  forehead  of  discoloured  wall  on  the  upper;  and
bore in every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence.
The  door,  which  was  equipped  with  neither  bell  nor  knocker,  was
blistered  and  distained.  Tramps  slouched  into  the  recess  and  struck
matches on the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the school-
boy had tried his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a genera-
tion, no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to
repair their ravages.

Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street;
but when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane
and pointed.

(cid:147)Did you ever remark that door?(cid:148) he asked; and when his compan-
ion had replied in the affirmative. (cid:147)It is connected in my mind,(cid:148) added
he, (cid:147)with a very odd story.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Indeed?(cid:148)  said  Mr.  Utterson,  with  a  slight  change  of  voice,  (cid:147)and

what was that?(cid:148)

(cid:147)Well, it was this way,(cid:148) returned Mr. Enfield: (cid:147)I was coming home
from some place at the end of the world, about three o(cid:146)clock of a black
winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there

was literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all
the folks asleep(cid:151)street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession
and all as empty as a church(cid:151)till at last I got into that state of mind
when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a
policeman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was
stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe
eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross
street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the
corner;  and  then  came  the  horrible  part  of  the  thing;  for  the  man
trampled calmly over the child(cid:146)s body and left her screaming on the
ground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn(cid:146)t
like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa,
took  to  my  heels,  collared  my  gentleman,  and  brought  him  back  to
where there was already quite a group about the screaming child. He
was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so
ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who
had turned out were the girl(cid:146)s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor,
for  whom  she  had  been  sent  put  in  his  appearance.  Well,  the  child
was not much the worse, more frightened, according to the Sawbones;
and there you might have supposed would be an end to it. But there
was  one  curious  circumstance.  I  had  taken  a  loathing  to  my  gentle-
man at first sight. So had the child(cid:146)s family, which was only natural.
But the doctor(cid:146)s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and
dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edin-
burgh accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was
like  the  rest  of  us;  every  time  he  looked  at  my  prisoner,  I  saw  that
Sawbones turn sick and white with desire to kill him. I knew what was
in his mind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of
the  question,  we  did  the  next  best.  We  told  the  man  we  could  and
would make such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink
from one end of London to the other. If he had any friends or any
credit, we undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we
were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best
we could for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such
hateful  faces;  and  there  was  the  man  in  the  middle,  with  a  kind  of
black sneering coolness(cid:151)frightened too, I could see that(cid:151)but carrying
it off, sir, really like Satan. (cid:145)If you choose to make capital out of this

accident,(cid:146) said he, (cid:145)I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but wishes
to avoid a scene,(cid:146) says he. (cid:145)Name your figure.(cid:146) Well, we screwed him up
to a hundred pounds for the child(cid:146)s family; he would have clearly liked
to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us that meant
mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get the money;
and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the door?(cid:151)
whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the matter
of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts(cid:146)s, drawn
payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can(cid:146)t mention, though
it(cid:146)s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least very well
known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the signature was
good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took the liberty of
pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked apocry-
phal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a cellar door at
four  in  the  morning  and  come  out  with  another  man(cid:146)s  cheque  for
close  upon  a  hundred  pounds.  But  he  was  quite  easy  and  sneering.
(cid:145)Set your mind at rest,(cid:146) says he, (cid:145)I will stay with you till the banks open
and  cash  the  cheque  myself.(cid:146)  So  we  all  set  of,  the  doctor,  and  the
child(cid:146)s father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the
night in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went
in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself, and said I had every
reason  to  believe  it  was  a  forgery.  Not  a  bit  of  it.  The  cheque  was
genuine.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Tut-tut,(cid:148) said Mr. Utterson.
(cid:147)I see you feel as I do,(cid:148) said Mr. Enfield. (cid:147)Yes, it(cid:146)s a bad story. For my
man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really damna-
ble man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the
proprieties,  celebrated  too,  and  (what  makes  it  worse)  one  of  your
fellows who do what they call good. Black mail I suppose; an honest
man  paying  through  the  nose  for  some  of  the  capers  of  his  youth.
Black  Mail  House  is  what  I  call  the  place  with  the  door,  in  conse-
quence. Though even that, you know, is far from explaining all,(cid:148) he
added, and with the words fell into a vein of musing.

From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly:

(cid:147)And you don(cid:146)t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?(cid:148)

(cid:147)A likely place, isn(cid:146)t it?(cid:148) returned Mr. Enfield. (cid:147)But I happen to have

noticed his address; he lives in some square or other.(cid:148)

STORY OF THE DOOR

(cid:147)And  you  never  asked  about  the(cid:151)place  with  the  door?(cid:148)  said  Mr.

Utterson.

(cid:147)No, sir: I had a delicacy,(cid:148) was the reply. (cid:147)I feel very strongly about
putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of judg-
ment. You start a question, and it(cid:146)s like starting a stone. You sit quietly
on  the  top  of  a  hill;  and  away  the  stone  goes,  starting  others;  and
presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of) is
knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to
change their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks
like Queer Street, the less I ask.(cid:148)

(cid:147)A very good rule, too,(cid:148) said the lawyer.
(cid:147)But I have studied the place for myself,(cid:148) continued Mr. Enfield. (cid:147)It
seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or
out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my adven-
ture. There are three windows looking on the court on the first floor;
none below; the windows are always shut but they(cid:146)re clean. And then
there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must live
there. And yet it(cid:146)s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed together
about  the  court,  that  it(cid:146)s  hard  to  say  where  one  ends  and  another
begins.(cid:148)

The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then (cid:147)Enfield,(cid:148)

said Mr. Utterson, (cid:147)that(cid:146)s a good rule of yours.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Yes, I think it is,(cid:148) returned Enfield.
(cid:147)But for all that,(cid:148) continued the lawyer, (cid:147)there(cid:146)s one point I want to
ask: I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.(cid:148)
(cid:147)Well,(cid:148) said Mr. Enfield, (cid:147)I can(cid:146)t see what harm it would do. It was

a man of the name of Hyde.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Hm,(cid:148) said Mr. Utterson. (cid:147)What sort of a man is he to see?(cid:148)
(cid:147)He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his ap-
pearance;  something  displeasing,  something  down-right  detestable.  I
never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be
deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although
I couldn(cid:146)t specify the point. He(cid:146)s an extraordinary looking man, and
yet I really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no
hand of it; I can(cid:146)t describe him. And it(cid:146)s not want of memory; for I
declare I can see him this moment.(cid:148)

Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under

6

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

a weight of consideration. (cid:147)You are sure he used a key?(cid:148) he inquired at
last.

(cid:147)My dear sir(cid:160)(cid:133)(cid:148) began Enfield, surprised out of himself.
(cid:147)Yes, I know,(cid:148) said Utterson; (cid:147)I know it must seem strange. The fact
is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I know
it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have been
inexact in any point you had better correct it.(cid:148)

(cid:147)I  think  you  might  have  warned  me,(cid:148)  returned  the  other  with  a
touch of sullenness. (cid:147)But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it.
The fellow had a key; and what(cid:146)s more, he has it still. I saw him use it
not a week ago.(cid:148)

Mr.  Utterson  sighed  deeply  but  said  never  a  word;  and  the  young
man presently resumed. (cid:147)Here is another lesson to say nothing,(cid:148) said
he. (cid:147)I am ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to
refer to this again.(cid:148)

(cid:147)With all my heart,(cid:148) said the lawyer. (cid:147)I shake hands on that, Rich-

ard.(cid:148)

SEARCH FOR MR. HYDE

THAT evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in som-
bre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of
a Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of
some  dry  divinity  on  his  reading  desk,  until  the  clock  of  the  neigh-
bouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go soberly
and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the cloth was
taken  away,  he  took  up  a  candle  and  went  into  his  business  room.
There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a docu-
ment endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll(cid:146)s Will and sat down with
a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for Mr.
Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had re-
fused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided not
only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D.,
F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands of his (cid:147)friend
and benefactor Edward Hyde,(cid:148) but that in case of Dr. Jekyll(cid:146)s (cid:147)disap-
pearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three cal-
endar months,(cid:148) the said Edward Hyde should step into the said Henry
Jekyll(cid:146)s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obli-
gation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the
doctor(cid:146)s  household.  This  document  had  long  been  the  lawyer(cid:146)s  eye-
sore. It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and
customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And
hitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his indig-
nation;  now,  by  a  sudden  turn,  it  was  his  knowledge.  It  was  already
bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn
no more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detest-
able attributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so
long  baffled  his  eye,  there  leaped  up  the  sudden,  definite  present-
ment of a fiend.

(cid:147)I thought it was madness,(cid:148) he said, as he replaced the obnoxious

paper in the safe, (cid:147)and now I begin to fear it is disgrace.(cid:148)

With that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth
in the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where
his friend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowd-

8

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

ing patients. (cid:147)If anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,(cid:148) he had thought.

The solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no
stage of delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room
where Dr. Lanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy,
dapper, red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white,
and a boisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he
sprang  up  from  his  chair  and  welcomed  him  with  both  hands.  The
geniality, as was the way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the
eye; but it reposed on genuine feeling.  For these two were old friends,
old  mates  both  at  school  and  college,  both  thorough  respectors  of
themselves and of each other, and what does not always follow, men
who thoroughly enjoyed each other(cid:146)s company.

After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so

disagreeably preoccupied his mind.

(cid:147)I  suppose,  Lanyon,(cid:148)  said  he,  (cid:147)you  and  I  must  be  the  two  oldest

friends that Henry Jekyll has?(cid:148)

(cid:147)I wish the friends were younger,(cid:148) chuckled Dr. Lanyon. (cid:147)But I sup-

pose we are. And what of that? I see little of him now.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Indeed?(cid:148)  said  Utterson.  (cid:147)I  thought  you  had  a  bond  of  common

interest.(cid:148)

(cid:147)We had,(cid:148) was the reply. (cid:147)But it is more than ten years since Henry
Jekyll  became  too  fanciful  for  me.  He  began  to  go  wrong,  wrong  in
mind; and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for
old sake(cid:146)s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the
man. Such unscientific balderdash,(cid:148) added the doctor, flushing sud-
denly purple, (cid:147)would have estranged Damon and Pythias.(cid:148)

This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.
(cid:147)They have only differed on some point of science,(cid:148) he thought; and
being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of convey-
ancing), he even added: (cid:147)It is nothing worse than that!(cid:148) He gave his
friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached
the question he had come to put. Did you ever come across a protege
of his(cid:151)one Hyde?(cid:148) he asked.

(cid:147)Hyde?(cid:148) repeated Lanyon. (cid:147)No. Never heard of him. Since my time.(cid:148)

That  was  the  amount  of  information  that  the  lawyer  carried  back
with him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until
the small hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of
little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and beseiged by
questions.  Six  o(cid:146)clock  stuck  on  the  bells  of  the  church  that  was  so
conveniently near to Mr. Utterson(cid:146)s dwelling, and still he was digging
at the problem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side
alone; but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved;
and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the
curtained room, Mr. Enfield(cid:146)s tale went by before his mind in a scroll
of lighted pictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a
nocturnal city; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a
child running from the doctor(cid:146)s; and then these met, and that human
juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams.
Or  else  he  would  see  a  room  in  a  rich  house,  where  his  friend  lay
asleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that
room  would  be  opened,  the  curtains  of  the  bed  plucked  apart,  the
sleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to whom
power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do its
bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night;
and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide more stealth-
ily  through  sleeping  houses,  or  move  the  more  swiftly  and  still  the
more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted
city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave her screaming.
And still the figure had no face by which he might know it; even in his
dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and melted before his
eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the law-
yer(cid:146)s  mind  a  singularly  strong,  almost  an  inordinate,  curiosity  to  be-
hold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but once set eyes on
him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether
away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined. He
might see a reason for his friend(cid:146)s strange preference or bondage (call
it which you please) and even for the startling clause of the will. At
least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was with-
out bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to raise up, in
the  mind  of  the  unimpressionable  Enfield,  a  spirit  of  enduring  ha-
tred.

10

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in
the  by-street  of  shops.  In  the  morning  before  office  hours,  at  noon
when business was plenty, and time scarce, at night under the face of
the fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or con-
course, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.

(cid:147)If he be Mr. Hyde,(cid:148) he had thought, (cid:147)I shall be Mr. Seek.(cid:148)
And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost
in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken
by  any  wind,  drawing  a  regular  pattern  of  light  and  shadow.  By  ten
o(cid:146)clock,  when  the  shops  were  closed  the  by-street  was  very  solitary
and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent.
Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly
audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach
of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been
some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light footstep
drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long grown
accustomed  to  the  quaint  effect  with  which  the  footfalls  of  a  single
person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct
from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention had never
before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong,
superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of
the court.

The  steps  drew  swiftly  nearer,  and  swelled  out  suddenly  louder  as
they turned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the
entry, could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He
was small and very plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that
distance,  went  somehow  strongly  against  the  watcher(cid:146)s  inclination.
But he made straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time;
and as he came, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching
home.

Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he

passed. (cid:147)Mr. Hyde, I think?(cid:148)

Mr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his
fear was only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in
the face, he answered coolly enough: (cid:147)That is my name. What do you
want?(cid:148)

(cid:147)I see you are going in,(cid:148) returned the lawyer. (cid:147)I am an old friend of

Dr. Jekyll(cid:146)s(cid:151)Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street(cid:151)you must have heard of my
name; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit
me.(cid:148)

(cid:147)You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,(cid:148) replied Mr. Hyde,
blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,
(cid:147)How did you know me?(cid:148) he asked.

(cid:147)On your side,(cid:148) said Mr. Utterson (cid:147)will you do me a favour?(cid:148)
(cid:147)With pleasure,(cid:148) replied the other. (cid:147)What shall it be?(cid:148)
(cid:147)Will you let me see your face?(cid:148) asked the lawyer.
Mr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden
reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared at
each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds.  (cid:147)Now I shall know you
again,(cid:148) said Mr. Utterson. (cid:147)It may be useful.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Yes,(cid:148) returned Mr. Hyde, (cid:147)lt is as well we have met; and apropos,
you  should  have  my  address.(cid:148)  And  he  gave  a  number  of  a  street  in
Soho.

(cid:147)Good God!(cid:148) thought Mr. Utterson, (cid:147)can he, too, have been think-
ing of the will?(cid:148) But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted
in acknowledgment of the address.

(cid:147)And now,(cid:148) said the other, (cid:147)how did you know me?(cid:148)
(cid:147)By description,(cid:148) was the reply.
(cid:147)Whose  description?(cid:148)
(cid:147)We have common friends,(cid:148) said Mr. Utterson.
(cid:147)Common  friends,(cid:148)  echoed  Mr.  Hyde,  a  little  hoarsely.  (cid:147)Who  are

they?(cid:148)

(cid:147)Jekyll, for instance,(cid:148) said the lawyer.
(cid:147)He never told you,(cid:148) cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. (cid:147)I did

not think you would have lied.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Come,(cid:148) said Mr. Utterson, (cid:147)that is not fitting language.(cid:148)
The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment,
with  extraordinary  quickness,  he  had  unlocked  the  door  and  disap-
peared into the house.

The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of
disquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every
step  or  two  and  putting  his  hand  to  his  brow  like  a  man  in  mental
perplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one
of a class that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave

12

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he
had a displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort
of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a
husky, whispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points
against him, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto
unknown disgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded
him. (cid:147)There must be something else,(cid:148) said the perplexed gentleman.
(cid:147)There is something more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me,
the man seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or
can it be the old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radience of a foul
soul that thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent?
The last,I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan(cid:146)s
signature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.(cid:148)

Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,
handsome  houses,  now  for  the  most  part  decayed  from  their  high
estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men;
map-engravers,  architects,  shady  lawyers  and  the  agents  of  obscure
enterprises.  One  house,  however,  second  from  the  corner,  was  still
occupied  entire;  and  at  the  door  of  this,  which  wore  a  great  air  of
wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for
the fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, eld-
erly servant opened the door.

(cid:147)Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?(cid:148) asked the lawyer.
(cid:147)I  will  see,  Mr.  Utterson,(cid:148)  said  Poole,  admitting  the  visitor,  as  he
spoke,  into  a  large,  low-roofed,  comfortable  hall  paved  with  flags,
warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire,
and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. (cid:147)Will you wait here by the
fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?(cid:148)

(cid:147)Here, thank you,(cid:148) said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on
the tall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet
fancy  of  his  friend  the  doctor(cid:146)s;  and  Utterson  himself  was  wont  to
speak of it as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a
shudder in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he
felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the
gloom of his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of
the firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the
shadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole pres-

ently returned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.

(cid:147)I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,(cid:148) he said. (cid:147)Is

that right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?(cid:148)

(cid:147)Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,(cid:148) replied the servant. (cid:147)Mr. Hyde has

a key.(cid:148)

him.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Your  master  seems  to  repose  a  great  deal  of  trust  in  that  young

man, Poole,(cid:148) resumed the other musingly.

(cid:147)Yes, sir, he does indeed,(cid:148) said Poole. (cid:147)We have all orders to obey

(cid:147)I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?(cid:148) asked Utterson.
(cid:147)O, dear no, sir. He never dines here,(cid:148) replied the butler. (cid:147)Indeed
we see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes and
goes by the laboratory.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Well, good-night, Poole.(cid:148)
(cid:147)Good-night, Mr. Utterson.(cid:148)
And  the  lawyer  set  out  homeward  with  a  very  heavy  heart.  (cid:147)Poor
Harry Jekyll,(cid:148) he thought, (cid:147)my mind misgives me he is in deep waters!
He was wild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the
law of God, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the
ghost of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace:  punish-
ment coming, pede claudo, years after memory has forgotten and self-
love  condoned  the  fault.(cid:148)  And  the  lawyer,  scared  by  the  thought,
brooded awhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory,
least by chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to
light there. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls
of their life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by
the many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and
fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided.
And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of
hope. (cid:147)This Master Hyde, if he were studied,(cid:148) thought he, (cid:147)must have
secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared
to  which  poor  Jekyll(cid:146)s  worst  would  be  like  sunshine.  Things  cannot
continue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature stealing
like a thief to Harry(cid:146)s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening! And the
danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the will, he may
grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to the wheel(cid:151)
if Jekyll will but let me,(cid:148) he added, (cid:147)if Jekyll will only let me.(cid:148) For once

14

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

more he saw before his mind(cid:146)s eye, as clear as transparency, the strange
clauses of the will.

DR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE

A  FORTNIGHT later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of
his  pleasant  dinners  to  some  five  or  six  old  cronies,  all  intelligent,
reputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so con-
trived  that  he  remained  behind  after  the  others  had  departed.  This
was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of
times.  Where  Utterson  was  liked,  he  was  liked  well.  Hosts  loved  to
detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had
already  their  foot  on  the  threshold;  they  liked  to  sit  a  while  in  his
unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in
the man(cid:146)s rich  silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this
rule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite
side  of  the  fire(cid:151)a  large,  well-made,  smooth-faced  man  of  fifty,  with
something  of  a  stylish  cast  perhaps,  but  every  mark  of  capacity  and
kindness(cid:151)you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson
a sincere and warm affection.

(cid:147)I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,(cid:148) began the latter. (cid:147)You

know that will of yours?(cid:148)

A close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful;
but the doctor carried it off gaily. (cid:147)My poor Utterson,(cid:148) said he, (cid:147)you
are unfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as you
were  by  my  will;  unless  it  were  that  hide-bound  pedant,  Lanyon,  at
what he called my scientific heresies. O, I know he(cid:146)s a good fellow(cid:151)
you needn(cid:146)t frown(cid:151)an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more
of  him;  but  a  hide-bound  pedant  for  all  that;  an  ignorant,  blatant
pedant. I was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.(cid:148)

(cid:147)You  know  I  never  approved  of  it,(cid:148)  pursued  Utterson,  ruthlessly

disregarding the fresh topic.

(cid:147)You have told me so.(cid:148)

(cid:147)My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,(cid:148) said the doctor, a trifle sharply.

(cid:147)Well, I tell you so again,(cid:148) continued the lawyer. (cid:147)I have been learn-

ing something of young Hyde.(cid:148)

The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and
there came a blackness about his eyes. (cid:147)I do not care to hear more,(cid:148)
said he. (cid:147)This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.(cid:148)

16

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

(cid:147)What I heard was abominable,(cid:148) said Utterson.
(cid:147)It can make no change. You do not understand my position,(cid:148) re-
turned the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. (cid:147)I am pain-
fully situated, Utterson; my position is a very strange(cid:151)a very strange
one. It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Jekyll,(cid:148)  said  Utterson,  (cid:147)you  know  me:  I  am  a  man  to  be  trusted.
Make a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can
get you out of it.(cid:148)

(cid:147)My good Utterson,(cid:148) said the doctor, (cid:147)this is very good of you, this
is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I
believe  you  fully;  I  would  trust  you  before  any  man  alive,  ay,  before
myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn(cid:146)t what you fancy;
it is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I will tell
you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde. I give
you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I will
just add one little word, Utterson, that I(cid:146)m sure you(cid:146)ll take in good
part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.(cid:148)

Utterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.
(cid:147)I have no doubt you are perfectly right,(cid:148) he said at last, getting to

his feet.

(cid:147)Well,  but  since  we  have  touched  upon  this  business,  and  for  the
last time I hope,(cid:148) continued the doctor, (cid:147)there is one point I should
like you to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde.
I know you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But
I do sincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and
if I am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will
bear  with  him  and  get  his  rights  for  him.  I  think  you would,  if  you
knew all; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.(cid:148)

(cid:147)I can(cid:146)t pretend that I shall ever like him,(cid:148) said the lawyer.
(cid:147)I don(cid:146)t ask that,(cid:148) pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other(cid:146)s
arm; (cid:147)I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake,
when I am no longer here.(cid:148)

Utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. (cid:147)Well,(cid:148) said he, (cid:147)I promise.(cid:148)

THE CAREW MURDER CASE

NEARLY a year later, in the month of October, 18(cid:151), London was star-
tled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable
by the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling.
A maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone
upstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in the
small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane,
which  the  maid(cid:146)s  window  overlooked,  was  brilliantly  lit  by  the  full
moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon her
box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a dream
of  musing.  Never  (she  used  to  say,  with  streaming  tears,  when  she
narrated  that  experience),  never  had  she  felt  more  at  peace  with  all
men or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she be-
came aware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing
near  along  the  lane;  and  advancing  to  meet  him,  another  and  very
small gentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they
had  come  within  speech  (which  was  just  under  the  maid(cid:146)s  eyes)  the
older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of
politeness. It did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great
importance; indeed, from his pointing, it some times appeared as if
he were only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he
spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such
an  innocent  and  old-world  kindness  of  disposition,  yet  with  some-
thing  high  too,  as  of  a  well-founded  self-content.  Presently  her  eye
wandered to the other, and she  was surprised to recognise in him a
certain Mr. Hyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she
had conceived a dislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which
he was trifling; but he answered never a word, and seemed to listen
with an ill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke
out in a great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the
cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The
old  gentleman  took  a  step  back,  with  the  air  of  one  very  much  sur-
prised and a trifle hurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds
and clubbed him to the earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury,
he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of

18

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

blows,  under  which  the  bones  were  audibly  shattered  and  the  body
jumped upon the roadway. At the horror of these sights and sounds,
the maid fainted.

It was two o(cid:146)clock when she came to herself and called for the po-
lice. The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the
middle of the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed
had been done, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy
wood,  had  broken  in  the  middle  under  the  stress  of  this  insensate
cruelty;  and  one  splintered  half  had  rolled  in  the  neighbouring  gut-
ter(cid:151)the other, without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer.
A purse and gold watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or
papers,  except  a  sealed  and  stamped  envelope,  which  he  had  been
probably carrying to the post, and which bore the name and address
of Mr. Utterson.

This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out
of bed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances,
than he shot out a solemn lip. (cid:147)I shall say nothing till I have seen the
body,(cid:148) said he; (cid:147)this may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait
while  I  dress.(cid:148)  And  with  the  same  grave  countenance  he  hurried
through his breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body
had been carried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.

(cid:147)Yes,(cid:148)  said  he,  (cid:147)I  recognise  him.  I  am  sorry  to  say  that  this  is  Sir

Danvers  Carew.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Good  God,  sir,(cid:148)  exclaimed  the  officer,  (cid:147)is  it  possible?(cid:148)  And  the
next moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. (cid:147)This will
make a deal of noise,(cid:148) he said. (cid:147)And perhaps you can help us to the
man.(cid:148) And he briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed
the broken stick.

Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when
the stick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and
battered as it was, he recognized it for one that he had himself pre-
sented many years before to Henry Jekyll.

(cid:147)Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?(cid:148) he inquired.
(cid:147)Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid

calls him,(cid:148) said the officer.

Mr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, (cid:147)If you will come

with me in my cab,(cid:148) he said, (cid:147)I think I can take you to his house.(cid:148)

THE CAREW MURDER CASE

19

It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of
the season. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but
the  wind  was  continually  charging  and  routing  these  embattled  va-
pours; so that as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson
beheld a marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it
would be dark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow
of  a  rich,  lurid  brown,  like  the  light  of  some  strange  conflagration;
and  here,  for  a  moment,  the  fog  would  be  quite  broken  up,  and  a
haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths.
The dismal quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with
its  muddy  ways,  and  slatternly  passengers,  and  its  lamps,  which  had
never  been  extinguished  or  had  been  kindled  afresh  to  combat  this
mournful reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer(cid:146)s eyes, like a
district  of  some  city  in  a  nightmare.  The  thoughts  of  his  mind,  be-
sides, were of the gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the compan-
ion of his drive, he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the
law and the law(cid:146)s officers, which may at times assail the most honest.
As  the  cab  drew  up  before  the  address  indicated,  the  fog  lifted  a
little and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating
house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads,
many ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of
many different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morn-
ing glass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that
part, as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly sur-
roundings. This was the home of Henry Jekyll(cid:146)s favourite; of a man
who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling.

An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She
had an evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excel-
lent. Yes, she said, this was Mr. Hyde(cid:146)s, but he was not at home; he
had been in that night very late, but he had gone away again in less
than an hour; there was nothing strange in that; his habits were very
irregular,  and  he  was  often  absent;  for  instance,  it  was  nearly  two
months since she had seen him till yesterday.

(cid:147)Very  well,  then,  we  wish  to  see  his  rooms,(cid:148)  said  the  lawyer;  and
when the woman began to declare it was impossible, (cid:147)I had better tell
you who this person is,(cid:148) he added. (cid:147)This is Inspector Newcomen of
Scotland  Yard.(cid:148)

20

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

A flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman(cid:146)s face. (cid:147)Ah!(cid:148) said

she, (cid:147)he is in trouble! What has he done?(cid:148)

Mr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. (cid:147)He don(cid:146)t seem
a  very  popular  character,(cid:148)  observed  the  latter.  (cid:147)And  now,  my  good
woman, just let me and this gentleman have a look about us.(cid:148)

In  the  whole  extent  of  the  house,  which  but  for  the  old  woman
remained otherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms;
but  these  were  furnished  with  luxury  and  good  taste.  A  closet  was
filled  with  wine;  the  plate  was  of  silver,  the  napery  elegant;  a  good
picture hung upon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry
Jekyll, who was much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many
plies  and  agreeable  in  colour.  At  this  moment,  however,  the  rooms
bore  every  mark  of  having  been  recently  and  hurriedly  ransacked;
clothes lay about the floor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast draw-
ers  stood  open;  and  on  the  hearth  there  lay  a  pile  of  grey  ashes,  as
though many papers had been burned. From these embers the inspec-
tor  disinterred  the  butt  end  of  a  green  cheque  book,  which  had  re-
sisted the action of the fire; the other half of the stick was found be-
hind the door; and as this clinched his suspicions, the officer declared
himself delighted. A visit to the bank, where several thousand pounds
were found to be lying to the murderer(cid:146)s credit, completed his gratifi-
cation.

(cid:147)You may depend upon it, sir,(cid:148) he told Mr. Utterson: (cid:147)I have him in
my hand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the
stick or, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money(cid:146)s life to the
man. We have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out
the handbills.(cid:148)

This last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde
had numbered few familiars(cid:151)even the master of the servant maid had
only seen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never
been  photographed;  and  the  few  who  could  describe  him  differed
widely, as common observers will. Only on one point were they agreed;
and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which
the fugitive impressed his beholders.

INCIDENT OF THE LETTER

IT was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr.
Jekyll(cid:146)s  door,  where  he  was  at  once  admitted  by  Poole,  and  carried
down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a
garden, to the building which was indifferently known as the labora-
tory or dissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the
heirs of a celebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemi-
cal than anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the
bottom of the garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been
received in that part of his friend(cid:146)s quarters; and he eyed the dingy,
windowless structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distaste-
ful sense of strangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with
eager students and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with
chemical apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with pack-
ing straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the
further  end,  a  flight  of  stairs  mounted  to  a  door  covered  with  red
baize;  and  through  this,  Mr.  Utterson  was  at  last  received  into  the
doctor(cid:146)s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses,
furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business ta-
ble, and looking out upon the court by three  dusty windows barred
with iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the
chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and
there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. He
did not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him
welcome in a changed voice.

(cid:147)And now,(cid:148) said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, (cid:147)you

have heard the news?(cid:148)

The doctor shuddered. (cid:147)They were crying it in the square,(cid:148) he said.

(cid:147)I heard them in my dining-room.(cid:148)

(cid:147)One word,(cid:148) said the lawyer. (cid:147)Carew was my client, but so are you,
and I want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough
to hide this fellow?(cid:148)

(cid:147)Utterson, I swear to God,(cid:148) cried the doctor, (cid:147)I swear to God I will
never set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done
with him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not

22

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

want my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite safe;
mark my words, he will never more be heard of.(cid:148)

The  lawyer  listened  gloomily;  he  did  not  like  his  friend(cid:146)s  feverish
manner. (cid:147)You seem pretty sure of him,(cid:148) said he; (cid:147)and for your sake, I
hope you may be right. If it came to a trial, our name might appear.(cid:148)
(cid:147)I am quite sure of him,(cid:148) replied Jekyll; (cid:147)I have grounds for certainty
that I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you
may  advise  me.  I  have(cid:151)I  have  received  a  letter;  and  I  am  at  a  loss
whether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in your
hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so great a
trust in you.(cid:148)

(cid:147)You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?(cid:148) asked the

lawyer.

(cid:147)No,(cid:148) said the other. (cid:147)I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde;
I am quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which
this hateful business has rather exposed.(cid:148)

Utterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend(cid:146)s selfish-
ness,  and  yet  relieved  by  it.  (cid:147)Well,(cid:148)  said  he,  at  last,  (cid:147)let  me  see  the
letter.(cid:148)

The letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed (cid:147)Edward
Hyde(cid:148):  and  it  signified,  briefly  enough,  that  the  writer(cid:146)s  benefactor,
Dr.  Jekyll,  whom  he  had  long  so  unworthily  repaid  for  a  thousand
generosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had means
of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked this
letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he had
looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.

(cid:147)Have you the envelope?(cid:148) he asked.
(cid:147)I burned it,(cid:148) replied Jekyll, (cid:147)before I thought what I was about. But

it bore no postmark. The note was handed in.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Shall I keep this and sleep upon it?(cid:148) asked Utterson.
(cid:147)I  wish  you  to  judge  for  me  entirely,(cid:148)  was  the  reply.  (cid:147)I  have  lost

confidence in myself.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Well,  I  shall  consider,(cid:148)  returned  the  lawyer.  (cid:147)And  now  one  word
more: it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that dis-
appearance?(cid:148)

The  doctor  seemed  seized  with  a  qualm  of  faintness;  he  shut  his

mouth tight and nodded.

INCIDENT OF THE LETTER

23

(cid:147)I knew it,(cid:148) said Utterson. (cid:147)He meant to murder you. You had a fine

escape.(cid:148)

(cid:147)I have had what is far more to the purpose,(cid:148) returned the doctor
solemnly: (cid:147)I have had a lesson(cid:151)O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have
had!(cid:148) And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.

On  his  way  out,  the  lawyer  stopped  and  had  a  word  or  two  with
Poole. (cid:147)By the bye,(cid:148) said he, (cid:147)there was a letter handed in to-day: what
was  the  messenger  like?(cid:148)  But  Poole  was  positive  nothing  had  come
except by post; (cid:147)and only circulars by that,(cid:148) he added.

This  news  sent  off  the  visitor  with  his  fears  renewed.  Plainly  the
letter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been
written in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently judged,
and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went, were
crying themselves hoarse along the footways: (cid:147)Special edition. Shock-
ing  murder  of  an  M.P.(cid:148)  That  was  the  funeral  oration  of  one  friend
and client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good
name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It
was, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and self-reliant as
he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for advice. It was not to
be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it might be fished for.

Presently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest,
his head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely calcu-
lated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine that had
long  dwelt  unsunned  in  the  foundations  of  his  house.  The  fog  still
slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps glimmered
like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these fallen
clouds, the procession of the town(cid:146)s life was still rolling in through the
great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the room was gay
with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago resolved; the impe-
rial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows richer in stained
windows;  and  the  glow  of  hot  autumn  afternoons  on  hillside  vine-
yards,  was  ready  to  be  set  free  and  to  disperse  the  fogs  of  London.
Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he kept
fewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he kept
as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the doc-
tor(cid:146)s; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr. Hyde(cid:146)s
familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it not as

24

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery to right?
and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic of handwrit-
ing, would consider the step natural and obliging? The clerk, besides,
was  a  man  of  counsel;  he  could  scarce  read  so  strange  a  document
without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson might
shape his future course.

(cid:147)This is a sad business about Sir Danvers,(cid:148) he said.
(cid:147)Yes,  sir,  indeed.  It  has  elicited  a  great  deal  of  public  feeling,(cid:148)  re-

turned Guest. (cid:147)The man, of course, was mad.(cid:148)

(cid:147)I should like to hear your views on that,(cid:148) replied Utterson.
(cid:147)I have a document here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves,
for I scarce know what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best.
But there it is; quite in your way: a murderer(cid:146)s autograph.(cid:148)

Guest(cid:146)s  eyes  brightened,  and  he  sat  down  at  once  and  studied  it

with passion. (cid:147)No sir,(cid:148) he said: (cid:147)not mad; but it is an odd hand.(cid:148)

(cid:147)And by all accounts a very odd writer,(cid:148) added the lawyer.
Just then the servant entered with a note.
(cid:147)Is that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?(cid:148) inquired the clerk. (cid:147)I thought I knew

the writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?(cid:148)

(cid:147)Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?(cid:148)
(cid:147)One moment. I thank you, sir;(cid:148) and the clerk laid the two sheets of

paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents.

(cid:147)Thank you, sir,(cid:148) he said at last, returning both; (cid:147)it(cid:146)s a very interest-

ing  autograph.(cid:148)

There was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with him-

self. (cid:147)Why did you compare them, Guest?(cid:148) he inquired suddenly.

(cid:147)Well, sir,(cid:148) returned the clerk, (cid:147)there(cid:146)s a rather singular resemblance;
the two hands are in many points identical: only differently sloped.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Rather quaint,(cid:148) said Utterson.
(cid:147)It is, as you say, rather quaint,(cid:148) returned Guest.
(cid:147)I wouldn(cid:146)t speak of this note, you know,(cid:148) said the master.
(cid:147)No, sir,(cid:148) said the clerk. (cid:147)I understand.(cid:148)
But no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked
the note into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. (cid:147)What!(cid:148)
he thought. (cid:147)Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer!(cid:148) And his blood ran
cold in his veins.

INCIDENT OF DR. LANYON

TIME  ran  on;  thousands  of  pounds  were  offered  in  reward,  for  the
death  of  Sir  Danvers  was  resented  as  a  public  injury;  but  Mr.  Hyde
had disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never
existed. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable:
tales came out of the man(cid:146)s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of
his vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to have
surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a whisper.
From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of the
murder,  he  was  simply  blotted  out;  and  gradually,  as  time  drew  on,
Mr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to
grow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his
way of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde.
Now that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for
Dr.  Jekyll.  He  came  out  of  his  seclusion,  renewed  relations  with  his
friends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and
whilst  he  had  always  been  known  for  charities,  he  was  now  no  less
distinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air,
he did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an in-
ward  consciousness  of  service;  and  for  more  than  two  months,  the
doctor was at peace.

On  the  8th  of  January  Utterson  had  dined  at  the  doctor(cid:146)s  with  a
small party; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked
from one to the other as in the old days when the trio were insepara-
ble friends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut
against  the  lawyer.  (cid:147)The  doctor  was  confined  to  the  house,(cid:148)  Poole
said, (cid:147)and saw no one.(cid:148) On the 15th, he tried again, and was again
refused; and having now been used for the last two months to see his
friend almost daily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his
spirits.  The  fifth  night  he  had  in  Guest  to  dine  with  him;  and  the
sixth he betook himself to Dr. Lanyon(cid:146)s.

There at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in,
he was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor(cid:146)s
appearance.  He  had  his  death-warrant  written  legibly  upon  his  face.
The rosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly

26

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

balder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift
physical  decay  that  arrested  the  lawyer(cid:146)s  notice,  as  a  look  in  the  eye
and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated ter-
ror of the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and
yet that was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. (cid:147)Yes,(cid:148) he thought;
he is a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted;
and the knowledge is more than he can bear.(cid:148) And yet when Utterson
remarked  on  his  ill-looks,  it  was  with  an  air  of  great  firmness  that
Lanyon declared himself a doomed man.

(cid:147)I  have  had  a  shock,(cid:148)  he  said,  (cid:147)and  I  shall  never  recover.  It  is  a
question  of  weeks.  Well,  life  has  been  pleasant;  I  liked  it;  yes,  sir,  I
used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more
glad to get away.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Jekyll is ill, too,(cid:148) observed Utterson. (cid:147)Have you seen him?(cid:148)
But  Lanyon(cid:146)s  face  changed,  and  he  held  up  a  trembling  hand.  (cid:147)I
wish to see or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,(cid:148) he said in a loud, unsteady
voice. (cid:147)I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare
me any allusion to one whom I regard as dead.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Tut-tut,(cid:148) said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,
(cid:147)Can(cid:146)t  I  do  anything?(cid:148)  he  inquired.  (cid:147)We  are  three  very  old  friends,
Lanyon; we shall not live to make others.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Nothing can be done,(cid:148) returned Lanyon; (cid:147)ask himself.(cid:148)
(cid:147)He will not see me,(cid:148) said the lawyer.
(cid:147)I  am  not  surprised  at  that,(cid:148)  was  the  reply.  (cid:147)Some  day,  Utterson,
after I am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of
this. I cannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk
with  me  of  other  things,  for  God(cid:146)s  sake,  stay  and  do  so;  but  if  you
cannot keep clear of this accursed topic, then in God(cid:146)s name, go, for I
cannot bear it.(cid:148)

As  soon  as  he  got  home,  Utterson  sat  down  and  wrote  to  Jekyll,
complaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of
this unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long
answer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysteri-
ous in drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. (cid:147)I do not blame
our old friend,(cid:148) Jekyll wrote, (cid:147)but I share his view that we must never
meet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you
must not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door

INCIDENT OF DR. LANYON

27

is often shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way.
I  have  brought  on  myself  a  punishment  and  a  danger  that  I  cannot
name. If I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I
could  not  think  that  this  earth  contained  a  place  for  sufferings  and
terrors  so  unmanning;  and  you  can  do  but  one  thing,  Utterson,  to
lighten this destiny, and that is to respect my silence.(cid:148) Utterson was
amazed; the dark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor
had  returned  to  his  old  tasks  and  amities;  a  week  ago,  the  prospect
had  smiled  with  every  promise  of  a  cheerful  and  an  honoured  age;
and now in a moment, friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole
tenor  of  his  life  were  wrecked.  So  great  and  unprepared  a  change
pointed to madness; but in view of Lanyon(cid:146)s manner and words, there
must lie for it some deeper ground.

A  week  afterwards  Dr.  Lanyon took  to  his  bed,  and  in  something
less than a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which
he had been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business
room, and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out
and set before him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with
the seal of his dead friend. (cid:147)PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson
ALONE, and in case of his predecease to be destroyed unread,(cid:148) so it
was emphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the
contents. (cid:147)I have buried one friend to-day,(cid:148) he thought: (cid:147)what if this
should cost me another?(cid:148)

And then he condemned the fear as a disloyalty, and broke the seal.
Within there was another enclosure, likewise sealed, and marked upon
the cover as (cid:147)not to be opened till the death or disappearance of Dr.
Henry Jekyll.(cid:148) Utterson could not trust his eyes. Yes, it was disappear-
ance; here again, as in the mad will which he had long ago restored to
its author, here again were the idea of a disappearance and the name
of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in the will, that idea had sprung from
the sinister suggestion of the man Hyde; it was set there with a pur-
pose all too plain and horrible. Written by the hand of Lanyon, what
should it mean? A great curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the
prohibition  and  dive  at  once  to  the  bottom  of  these  mysteries;  but
professional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent obliga-
tions; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his private safe.

It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may

28

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

be doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his
surviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly;
but his thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed;
but he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his
heart,  he  preferred  to  speak  with  Poole  upon  the  doorstep  and  sur-
rounded  by  the  air  and  sounds  of  the  open  city,  rather  than  to  be
admitted into that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak
with its inscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news
to  communicate.  The  doctor,  it  appeared,  now  more  than  ever  con-
fined himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would some-
times even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did
not  read;  it  seemed  as  if  he  had  something  on  his  mind.  Utterson
became  so  used  to  the  unvarying  character  of  these  reports,  that  he
fell off little by little in the frequency of his visits.

INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW

IT chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with
Mr. Enfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and
that when they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.
(cid:147)Well,(cid:148) said Enfield, (cid:147)that story(cid:146)s at an end at least. We shall never

see more of Mr. Hyde.(cid:148)

(cid:147)I hope not,(cid:148) said Utterson. (cid:147)Did I ever tell you that I once saw him,

and shared your feeling of repulsion?(cid:148)

(cid:147)It was impossible to do the one without the other,(cid:148) returned En-
field. (cid:147)And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to
know that this was a back way to Dr. Jekyll(cid:146)s! It was partly your own
fault that I found it out, even when I did.(cid:148)

(cid:147)So you found it out, did you?(cid:148) said Utterson. (cid:147)But if that be so, we
may step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the
truth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if the
presence of a friend might do him good.(cid:148)

The  court  was  very  cool  and  a  little  damp,  and  full  of  premature
twilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with sun-
set.  The  middle  one  of  the  three  windows  was  half-way  open;  and
sitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of mien,
like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.

(cid:147)What!  Jekyll!(cid:148) he cried. (cid:147)I trust you are better.(cid:148)
(cid:147)I am very low, Utterson,(cid:148) replied the doctor drearily, (cid:147)very low. It

will not last long, thank God.(cid:148)

(cid:147)You stay too much indoors,(cid:148) said the lawyer. (cid:147)You should be out,
whipping  up  the  circulation  like  Mr.  Enfield  and  me.  (This  is  my
cousin(cid:151)Mr. Enfield(cid:151)Dr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a
quick turn with us.(cid:148)

(cid:147)You are very good,(cid:148) sighed the other. (cid:147)I should like to very much;
but no, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson,
I am very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask you
and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Why, then,(cid:148) said the lawyer, good-naturedly, (cid:147)the best thing we can

do is to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.(cid:148)

(cid:147)That is just what I was about to venture to propose,(cid:148) returned the

30

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

doctor  with  a  smile.  But  the  words  were  hardly  uttered,  before  the
smile  was  struck  out  of  his  face  and  succeeded  by  an  expression  of
such abject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gen-
tlemen below. They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was in-
stantly  thrust  down;  but  that  glimpse  had  been  sufficient,  and  they
turned  and  left  the  court  without  a  word.  In  silence,  too,  they  tra-
versed the by-street; and it was not until they had come into a neigh-
bouring thoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some
stirrings  of  life,  that  Mr.  Utterson  at  last  turned  and  looked  at  his
companion. They were both pale; and there was an answering horror
in their eyes.

(cid:147)God forgive us, God forgive us,(cid:148) said Mr. Utterson.
But Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on

once more in silence.

THE LAST NIGHT

MR. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when
he was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.

(cid:147)Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?(cid:148) he cried; and then taking a

second look at him, (cid:147)What ails you?(cid:148) he added; (cid:147)is the doctor ill?(cid:148)

(cid:147)Mr. Utterson,(cid:148) said the man, (cid:147)there is something wrong.(cid:148)
(cid:147)Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,(cid:148) said the lawyer.

(cid:147)Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.(cid:148)

(cid:147)You know the doctor(cid:146)s ways, sir,(cid:148) replied Poole, (cid:147)and how he shuts
himself up. Well, he(cid:146)s shut up again in the cabinet; and I don(cid:146)t like it,
sir(cid:151)I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I(cid:146)m afraid.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Now, my good man,(cid:148) said the lawyer, (cid:147)be explicit.  What are you

afraid of?(cid:148)

(cid:147)I(cid:146)ve been afraid for about a week,(cid:148) returned Poole, doggedly disre-

garding the question, (cid:147)and I can bear it no more.(cid:148)

The  man(cid:146)s  appearance  amply  bore  out  his  words;  his  manner  was
altered for the worse; and except for the moment when he had first
announced his terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face.
Even now, he sat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his
eyes  directed  to  a  corner  of  the  floor.  (cid:147)I  can  bear  it  no  more,(cid:148)  he
repeated.

(cid:147)Come,(cid:148) said the lawyer, (cid:147)I see you have some good reason, Poole; I

see there is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is.(cid:148)

(cid:147)I think there(cid:146)s been foul play,(cid:148) said Poole, hoarsely.
(cid:147)Foul play!(cid:148) cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather in-
clined to be irritated in consequence. (cid:147)What foul play! What does the
man mean?(cid:148)

(cid:147)I daren(cid:146)t say, sir,(cid:148) was the answer; (cid:147)but will you come along with me

and see for yourself?(cid:148)

Mr. Utterson(cid:146)s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat;
but he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared
upon the butler(cid:146)s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was still
untasted when he set it down to follow.

It was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon,
lying on her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack

32

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

of  the  most  diaphanous  and  lawny  texture.  The  wind  made  talking
difficult, and flecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept
the  streets  unusually  bare  of  passengers,  besides;  for  Mr.  Utterson
thought he had never seen that part of London so deserted. He could
have wished it otherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so
sharp a wish to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he
might, there was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of
calamity. The square, when they got there, was full of wind and dust,
and  the  thin  trees  in  the  garden  were  lashing  themselves  along  the
railing.  Poole,  who  had  kept  all  the  way  a  pace  or  two  ahead,  now
pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting
weather,  took  off  his  hat  and  mopped  his  brow  with  a  red  pocket-
handkerchief. But for all the hurry of his coming, these were not the
dews of exertion that he wiped away, but the moisture of some stran-
gling  anguish;  for  his  face  was  white  and  his  voice,  when  he  spoke,
harsh and broken.

(cid:147)Well, sir,(cid:148) he said, (cid:147)here we are, and God grant there be nothing

wrong.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Amen, Poole,(cid:148) said the lawyer.
Thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door
was opened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, (cid:147)Is that you,
Poole?(cid:148)

(cid:147)It(cid:146)s all right,(cid:148) said Poole. (cid:147)Open the door.(cid:148)
The hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was
built high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and
women, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of
Mr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and
the cook, crying out (cid:147)Bless God! it(cid:146)s Mr. Utterson,(cid:148) ran forward as if
to take him in her arms.

(cid:147)What,  what?  Are  you  all  here?(cid:148)  said  the  lawyer  peevishly.  (cid:147)Very

irregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased.(cid:148)

(cid:147)They(cid:146)re all afraid,(cid:148) said Poole.
Blank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted her

voice and now wept loudly.

(cid:147)Hold your tongue!(cid:148) Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that
testified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so
suddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and

THE LAST NIGHT

33

turned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. (cid:147)And
now,(cid:148) continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, (cid:147)reach me a can-
dle, and we(cid:146)ll get this through hands at once.(cid:148) And then he begged
Mr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.

(cid:147)Now, sir,(cid:148) said he, (cid:147)you come as gently as you can. I want you to
hear, and I don(cid:146)t want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any
chance he was to ask you in, don(cid:146)t go.(cid:148)

Mr. Utterson(cid:146)s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk
that nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage
and followed the butler into the laboratory building through the sur-
gical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of the
stair. Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen; while
he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and obvious
call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a some-
what uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door.

(cid:147)Mr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you,(cid:148) he called; and even as he did

so, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.

A voice  answered  from  within:  (cid:147)Tell  him  I  cannot  see  anyone,(cid:148)  it

said  complainingly.

(cid:147)Thank you, sir,(cid:148) said Poole, with a note of something like triumph
in his voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across
the  yard  and  into  the  great  kitchen,  where  the  fire was  out  and  the
beetles were leaping on the floor.

(cid:147)Sir,(cid:148) he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, (cid:147)Was that my mas-

(cid:147)It seems much changed,(cid:148) replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving

ter(cid:146)s voice?(cid:148)

look for look.

(cid:147)Changed? Well, yes, I think so,(cid:148) said the butler. (cid:147)Have I been twenty
years  in  this  man(cid:146)s  house,  to  be  deceived  about  his  voice?  No,  sir;
master(cid:146)s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when
we  heard  him  cry  out  upon  the  name  of  God;  and  who(cid:146)s  in  there
instead of him, and why it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven,
Mr.  Utterson!(cid:148)

(cid:145)This is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my man,(cid:148)
said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. (cid:147)Suppose it were as you suppose,
supposing Dr. Jekyll to have been(cid:151)well, murdered what could induce
the murderer to stay? That won(cid:146)t hold water; it doesn(cid:146)t commend it-

34

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

self to reason.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Well, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I(cid:146)ll do it yet,(cid:148)
said Poole. (cid:147)All this last week (you must know) him, or it, whatever it is
that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and day for some sort
of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was sometimes his way(cid:151)
the master(cid:146)s, that is(cid:151)to write his orders on a sheet of paper and throw
it  on  the  stair.  We(cid:146)ve  had  nothing  else  this  week  back;  nothing  but
papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left there to be smuggled
in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day, ay, and twice and
thrice in the same day, there have been orders and complaints, and I
have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists in town. Every time
I brought the stuff back, there would be another paper telling me to
return  it,  because  it  was  not  pure,  and  another  order  to  a  different
firm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir, whatever for.(cid:148)
(cid:147)Have you any of these papers?(cid:148) asked Mr. Utterson.
Poole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the
lawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents
ran  thus:  (cid:147)Dr.  Jekyll  presents  his  compliments  to  Messrs.  Maw.  He
assures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his
present purpose. In the year 18(cid:151), Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large
quantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with most sedu-
lous care, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him
at once. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J.
can  hardly  be  exaggerated.(cid:148)  So  far  the  letter  had  run  composedly
enough, but here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer(cid:146)s emo-
tion had broken loose. (cid:147)For God(cid:146)s sake,(cid:148) he added, (cid:147)find me some of
the old.(cid:148)

(cid:147)This is a strange note,(cid:148) said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, (cid:147)How

do you come to have it open?(cid:148)

(cid:147)The man at Maw(cid:146)s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me

like so much dirt,(cid:148) returned Poole.

(cid:147)This is unquestionably the doctor(cid:146)s hand, do you know?(cid:148) resumed

the lawyer.

(cid:147)I thought it looked like it,(cid:148) said the servant rather sulkily; and then,
with another voice, (cid:147)But what matters hand of write?(cid:148) he said. (cid:147)I(cid:146)ve
seen him!(cid:148)

(cid:147)Seen him?(cid:148) repeated Mr. Utterson. (cid:147)Well?(cid:148)

THE LAST NIGHT

35

(cid:147)That(cid:146)s  it!(cid:148)  said  Poole.  (cid:147)It  was  this  way.  I  came  suddenly  into  the
theater from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this
drug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was
at the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up
when  I  came  in,  gave  a  kind  of  cry,  and  whipped  upstairs  into  the
cabinet. It was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood
upon my head like quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask
upon his face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and
run from me? I have served him long enough. And then(cid:160)(cid:133)(cid:148)  The man
paused and passed his hand over his face.

(cid:147)These are all very strange circumstances,(cid:148) said Mr. Utterson, (cid:147)but I
think I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole, is plainly seized with
one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer; hence,
for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask and the
avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this drug, by means
of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate recovery(cid:151)God
grant that he be not deceived! There is my explanation; it is sad enough,
Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain and natural, hangs
well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant alarms.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Sir,(cid:148) said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, (cid:147)that thing
was not my master, and there(cid:146)s the truth. My master(cid:148)(cid:151)here he looked
round him and began to whisper(cid:151)(cid:147)is a tall, fine build of a man, and
this was more of a dwarf.(cid:148)

Utterson attempted to protest. (cid:147)O, sir,(cid:148) cried Poole, (cid:147)do you think I
do  not  know  my  master  after  twenty  years?  Do  you  think  I  do  not
know where his head comes to in the cabinet door, where I saw him
every morning of my life? No, sir, that thing in the mask was never Dr.
Jekyll(cid:151)God knows what it was, but it was never Dr. Jekyll; and it is the
belief of my heart that there was murder done.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Poole,(cid:148) replied the lawyer, (cid:147)if you say that, it will become my duty
to make certain. Much as I desire to spare your master(cid:146)s feelings, much
as I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still alive,
I shall consider it my duty to break in that door.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Ah, Mr. Utterson, that(cid:146)s talking!(cid:148) cried the butler.
(cid:147)And now comes the second question,(cid:148) resumed Utterson: (cid:147)Who is

going to do it?(cid:148)

(cid:147)Why, you and me, sir,(cid:148) was the undaunted reply.

36

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

(cid:147)That(cid:146)s very well said,(cid:148) returned the lawyer; (cid:147)and whatever comes of

it, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser.(cid:148)

(cid:147)There is an axe in the theatre,(cid:148) continued Poole; (cid:147)and you might

take the kitchen poker for yourself.(cid:148)

The  lawyer  took  that  rude  but  weighty  instrument  into  his  hand,
and balanced it. (cid:147)Do you know, Poole,(cid:148) he said, looking up, (cid:147)that you
and I are about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?(cid:148)

(cid:147)You may say so, sir, indeed,(cid:148) returned the butler.
(cid:147)It is well, then that we should be frank,(cid:148) said the other.
(cid:147)We both think more than we have said; let us make a clean breast.

This masked figure that you saw, did you recognise it?(cid:148)

(cid:147)Well, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that
I could hardly swear to that,(cid:148) was the answer. (cid:147)But if you mean, was it
Mr. Hyde?(cid:151)why, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the same
bigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who
else could have got in by the laboratory door?  You have not forgot, sir,
that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him?  But that(cid:146)s
not all.  I don(cid:146)t know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr. Hyde?(cid:148)

(cid:147)Yes,(cid:148) said the lawyer, (cid:147)I once spoke with him.(cid:148)
(cid:147)Then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was some-
thing queer about that gentleman(cid:151)something that gave a man a turn(cid:151)
I don(cid:146)t know rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your
marrow kind of cold and thin.(cid:148)

(cid:147)I own I felt something of what you describe,(cid:148) said Mr. Utterson.
(cid:147)Quite so, sir,(cid:148) returned Poole. (cid:147)Well, when that masked thing like
a monkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the
cabinet, it went down my spine like ice. O, I know it(cid:146)s not evidence,
Mr.  Utterson;  I(cid:146)m  book-learned  enough  for  that;  but  a  man  has  his
feelings, and I give you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!(cid:148)

(cid:147)Ay, ay,(cid:148) said the lawyer. (cid:147)My fears incline to the same point. Evil, I
fear,  founded(cid:151)evil  was  sure  to  come(cid:151)of  that  connection.  Ay  truly,  I
believe you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer
(for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victim(cid:146)s
room. Well, let our name be vengeance. Call Bradshaw.(cid:148)

The footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.
(cid:147)Put yourself together, Bradshaw,(cid:148) said the lawyer. (cid:147)This suspense, I
know, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make an

THE LAST NIGHT

37

end of it. Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into the cabinet.
If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear the blame. Mean-
while, lest anything should really be amiss, or any malefactor seek to
escape by the back, you and the boy must go round the corner with a
pair of good sticks and take your post at the laboratory door. We give
you ten minutes, to get to your stations.(cid:148)

As Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. (cid:147)And now, Poole,
let us get to ours,(cid:148) he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the
way into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was
now quite  dark.  The  wind,  which  only  broke  in  puffs  and  draughts
into that deep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and
fro about their steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre,
where  they  sat  down  silently  to wait.  London  hummed  solemnly  all
around; but nearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds
of a footfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor.

(cid:147)So it will walk all day, sir,(cid:148) whispered Poole; (cid:147)ay, and the better part
of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist, there(cid:146)s
a bit of a break. Ah, it(cid:146)s an ill conscience that(cid:146)s such an enemy to rest!
Ah, sir, there(cid:146)s blood foully shed in every step of it! But hark again, a
little closer(cid:151)put your heart in your ears, Mr. Utterson, and tell me, is
that the doctor(cid:146)s foot?(cid:148)

The  steps  fell  lightly  and  oddly,  with  a  certain  swing,  for  all  they
went so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread
of  Henry  Jekyll.  Utterson  sighed.  (cid:147)Is  there  never  anything  else?(cid:148)  he
asked.

Poole nodded. (cid:147)Once,(cid:148) he said. (cid:147)Once I heard it weeping!(cid:148)
(cid:147)Weeping? how that?(cid:148) said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of

horror.

(cid:147)Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,(cid:148) said the butler. (cid:147)I came away

with that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.(cid:148)

But now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe
from under a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the near-
est table to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated
breath to where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and
down, in the quiet of the night. (cid:147)Jekyll,(cid:148) cried Utterson, with a loud
voice, (cid:147)I demand to see you.(cid:148) He paused a moment, but there came
no reply. (cid:147)I give you fair warning, our suspicions are aroused, and I

38

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

must and shall see you,(cid:148) he resumed; (cid:147)if not by fair means, then by
foul(cid:151)if not of your consent, then by brute force!(cid:148)

(cid:147)Utterson,(cid:148) said the voice, (cid:147)for God(cid:146)s sake, have mercy!(cid:148)
(cid:147)Ah,  that(cid:146)s  not  Jekyll(cid:146)s  voice(cid:151)it(cid:146)s  Hyde(cid:146)s!(cid:148)  cried  Utterson.  (cid:147)Down

with the door, Poole!(cid:148)

Poole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building,
and the red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal
screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the
axe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four
times the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of
excellent  workmanship;  and  it  was  not  until  the  fifth,  that  the  lock
burst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.

The besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had
succeeded,  stood  back  a  little  and  peered  in.  There  lay  the  cabinet
before their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and chat-
tering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer or two
open,  papers  neatly  set  forth  on  the  business  table,  and  nearer  the
fire,  the  things  laid  out  for  tea;  the  quietest  room,  you  would  have
said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most com-
monplace that night in London.

Right  in  the  middle  there  lay  the  body  of  a  man  sorely  contorted
and still twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and
beheld  the  face  of  Edward  Hyde.    He  was  dressed  in  clothes  far  to
large for him, clothes of the doctor(cid:146)s bigness; the cords of his face still
moved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone: and by the
crushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung
upon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a self-
destroyer.

(cid:147)We have come too late,(cid:148) he said sternly, (cid:147)whether to save or pun-
ish. Hyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the
body of your master.(cid:148)

The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the thea-
tre, which filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from
above, and by the cabinet, which formed an upper story at one end
and looked upon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door
on the by-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately
by a second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and

THE LAST NIGHT

39

a spacious cellar. All these they now thorougly examined. Each closet
needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell
from their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was
filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon
who was Jekyll(cid:146)s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they
were  advertised  of  the  uselessness  of  further  search,  by  the  fall  of  a
perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance. No
where was there any trace of Henry Jekyll dead or alive.

Poole  stamped  on  the  flags  of  the  corridor.  (cid:147)He  must  be  buried

here,(cid:148) he said, hearkening to the sound.

(cid:147)Or he may have fled,(cid:148) said Utterson, and he turned to examine the
door in the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they
found the key, already stained with rust.

(cid:147)This does not look like use,(cid:148) observed the lawyer.
(cid:147)Use!(cid:148) echoed Poole. (cid:147)Do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a

man had stamped on it.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Ay,(cid:148)  continued  Utterson,  (cid:147)and  the  fractures,  too,  are  rusty.(cid:148)  The
two men looked at each other with a scare. (cid:147)This is beyond me, Poole,(cid:148)
said the lawyer. (cid:147)Let us go back to the cabinet.(cid:148)

They mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional awe-
struck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to exam-
ine  the  contents  of  the  cabinet.  At  one  table,  there  were  traces  of
chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid
on glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy
man had been prevented.

(cid:147)That is the same drug that I was always bringing him,(cid:148) said Poole;

and even as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.

This brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn
cosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter(cid:146)s elbow, the very
sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay beside
the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy of a
pious  work,  for  which  Jekyll  had  several  times  expressed  a  great  es-
teem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies.

Next,  in  the  course  of  their  review  of  the  chamber,  the  searchers
came to the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an invol-
untary horror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the
rosy glow playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repeti-

40

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

tions  along  the  glazed  front  of  the  presses,  and  their  own  pale  and
fearful countenances stooping to look in.

(cid:147)This glass has seen some strange things, sir,(cid:148) whispered Poole.
(cid:147)And  surely  none  stranger  than  itself,(cid:148)  echoed  the  lawyer  in  the
same tones. (cid:147)For what did Jekyll(cid:148)(cid:151)he caught himself up at the word
with  a  start,  and  then  conquering  the  weakness(cid:151)(cid:147)what  could  Jekyll
want with it?(cid:148) he said.

(cid:147)You may say that!(cid:148) said Poole.
Next  they  turned  to  the  business  table.  On  the  desk,  among  the
neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the
doctor(cid:146)s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and
several enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in the
same  eccentric  terms  as  the  one  which  he  had  returned  six  months
before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in
case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the
lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John
Utterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of
all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.

(cid:147)My head goes round,(cid:148) he said. (cid:147)He has been all these days in pos-
session; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see himself
displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.(cid:148)

He caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor(cid:146)s hand
and dated at the top. (cid:147)O Poole!(cid:148) the lawyer cried, (cid:147)he was alive and
here this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he
must be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how?
and in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must be
careful.  I  foresee  that  we  may  yet  involve  your  master  in  some  dire
catastrophe.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Why don(cid:146)t you read it, sir?(cid:148) asked Poole.
(cid:147)Because I fear,(cid:148) replied the lawyer solemnly. (cid:147)God grant I have no
cause for it!(cid:148) And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read
as follows:

(cid:147)My dear Utterson,(cid:151)When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have
disappeared,  under  what  circumstances  I  have  not  the  penetration  to
foresee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless situa-
tion tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and first read
the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your hands;

THE LAST NIGHT

41

and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of

(cid:147)Your unworthy and unhappy friend,
                              (cid:147)HENRY JEKYLL.(cid:148)

(cid:147)There was a third enclosure?(cid:148) asked Utterson.
(cid:147)Here, sir,(cid:148) said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet

sealed in several places.

The lawyer put it in his pocket. (cid:147)I would say nothing of this paper. If
your master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It is now
ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall be
back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.(cid:148)

They went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and
Utterson,  once  more  leaving  the  servants  gathered  about  the  fire  in
the hall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which
this mystery was now to be explained.

DR. LANYON(cid:146)S NARRATIVE

ON the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening
delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague
and old school companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good deal surprised
by this; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had
seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could
imagine  nothing  in  our  intercourse  that  should  justify  formality  of
registration.  The  contents  increased  my  wonder;  for  this  is  how  the
letter ran:

(cid:147)10th December, 18(cid:151).
(cid:147)Dear Lanyon,(cid:151)You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may
have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at least
on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day when, if you
had said to me, (cid:145)Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason, depend upon you,(cid:146)
I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you. Lanyon my life, my
honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you fail me to-night, I am lost.
You  might  suppose,  after  this  preface,  that  I  am  going  to  ask  you  for
something dishonourable to grant. Judge for yourself.

(cid:147)I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night(cid:151)ay, even if
you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless
your carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in your
hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my butler,
has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a locksmith.
The door of my cabinet is then to be forced: and you are to go in alone; to
open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand, breaking the lock if it be
shut; and to draw out, with all its contents as they stand, the fourth drawer
from the top or (which is the same thing) the third from the bottom. In
my extreme distress of mind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you;
but even if I am in error, you may know the right drawer by its contents:
some powders, a phial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to
carry back with you to Cavendish Square exactly as it stands.

(cid:147)That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should be
back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before midnight;
but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the fear of one of
those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor foreseen, but because
an hour when your servants are in bed is to be preferred for what will
then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to ask you to be alone in

DR. LANYON(cid:146)S NARRATIVE

43

your consulting room, to admit with your own hand into the house a
man who will present himself in my name, and to place in his hands the
drawer that you will have brought with you from my cabinet. Then you
will have played your part and earned my gratitude completely. Five min-
utes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation, you will have under-
stood that these arrangements are of capital importance; and that by the
neglect of one of them, fantastic as they must appear, you might have
charged your conscience with my death or the shipwreck of my reason.
(cid:147)Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart
sinks  and  my  hand  trembles  at  the  bare  thought  of  such  a  possibility.
Think of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a blackness
of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware that, if you will
but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away like a story that is told.
Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save
                                 (cid:147)Your friend,
                                              (cid:147)H.J.
(cid:147)P.S.(cid:151)I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my
soul.  It  is  possible  that  the  post-office  may  fail  me,  and  this  letter  not
come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case, dear Lanyon,
do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the course of
the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It may then
already be too late; and if that night passes without event, you will know
that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.(cid:148)
Upon  the  reading  of  this  letter,  I  made  sure  my  colleague  was  in-
sane;  but  till  that  was  proved  beyond  the  possibility  of  doubt,  I  felt
bound to do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the
less I was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so
worded  could  not  be  set  aside  without  a  grave  responsibility.  I  rose
accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to Jekyll(cid:146)s
house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by the same
post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent at once for
a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we were yet
speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman(cid:146)s surgical thea-
tre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll(cid:146)s private cabinet is
most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the lock excel-
lent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and have to do
much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was near
despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour(cid:146)s work,
the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took

44

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

out  the  drawer,  had  it  filled  up  with  straw  and  tied  in  a  sheet,  and
returned with it to Cavendish Square.

Here I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly
enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist;
so that it was plain they were of Jekyll(cid:146)s private manufacture: and when
I  opened  one  of  the  wrappers  I  found  what  seemed  to  me  a  simple
crystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned my
attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor, which
was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to contain
phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I could
make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and contained
little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many years, but I
observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly.
Here  and  there  a  brief  remark  was  appended  to  a  date,  usually  no
more  than  a  single  word:  (cid:147)double(cid:148)  occurring  perhaps  six  times  in  a
total  of  several  hundred  entries;  and  once  very  early  in  the  list  and
followed  by  several  marks  of  exclamation,  (cid:147)total  failure!!!(cid:148)  All  this,
though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was definite. Here
were  a  phial  of  some  salt,  and  the  record  of  a  series  of  experiments
that  had  led  (like  too  many  of  Jekyll(cid:146)s  investigations)  to  no  end  of
practical  usefulness.  How  could  the  presence  of  these  articles  in  my
house  affect  either  the  honour,  the  sanity,  or  the  life  of  my  flighty
colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, why could he not go
to another? And even granting some impediment, why was this gentle-
man  to  be  received  by  me  in  secret?  The  more  I  reflected  the  more
convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral disease; and
though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old revolver, that I
might be found in some posture of self-defence.

Twelve o(cid:146)clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker
sounded very gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and
found a small man crouching against the pillars of the portico.

(cid:147)Are you come from Dr. Jekyll?(cid:148) I asked.
He told me (cid:147)yes(cid:148) by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden
him enter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance
into  the  darkness  of  the  square.  There was  a  policeman  not  far  off,
advancing  with  his  bull(cid:146)s  eye  open;  and  at  the  sight,  I  thought  my
visitor started and made greater haste.

DR. LANYON(cid:146)S NARRATIVE

45

These  particulars  struck  me,  I  confess,  disagreeably;  and  as  I  fol-
lowed  him  into  the  bright  light  of  the  consulting  room,  I  kept  my
hand  ready  on  my  weapon.  Here,  at  last,  I  had  a  chance  of  clearly
seeing him. I had never set eyes on him before, so much was certain.
He was small, as I have said; I was struck besides with the shocking
expression of his face, with his remarkable combination of great mus-
cular activity and great apparent debility of constitution, and(cid:151)last but
not  least(cid:151)with  the  odd,  subjective  disturbance  caused  by  his  neigh-
bourhood. This bore some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was
accompanied by a marked sinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it
down to some idiosyncratic, personal distaste, and merely wondered
at the acuteness of the symptoms; but I have since had reason to be-
lieve the cause to lie much deeper in the nature of man, and to turn
on some nobler hinge than the principle of hatred.

This person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance,
struck  in  me  what  I  can  only,  describe  as  a  disgustful  curiosity)  was
dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laugh-
able; his clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober
fabric, were enormously too large for him in every measurement(cid:151)the
trousers  hanging  on  his  legs  and  rolled  up  to  keep  them  from  the
ground, the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar sprawl-
ing wide upon his shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous accoutre-
ment was far from moving me to laughter. Rather, as there was some-
thing abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature
that  now  faced  me(cid:151)something  seizing,  surprising  and  revolting(cid:151)this
fresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that to
my interest in the man(cid:146)s nature and character, there was added a curi-
osity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in the world.

These observations, though they have taken so great a space to be
set down in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was, in-
deed, on fire with sombre excitement.

(cid:147)Have you got it?(cid:148) he cried. (cid:147)Have you got it?(cid:148) And so lively was his
impatience  that  he  even  laid  his  hand  upon  my  arm  and  sought  to
shake me.

I put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my
blood. (cid:147)Come, sir,(cid:148) said I. (cid:147)You forget that I have not yet the pleasure
of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.(cid:148) And I showed him an

46

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as fair an
imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness of the
hour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had of my
visitor, would suffer me to muster.

(cid:147)I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,(cid:148) he replied civilly enough. (cid:147)What
you say is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to
my politeness. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Henry
Jekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood(cid:160)(cid:133)(cid:148)
He paused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of
his collected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of
the hysteria(cid:151)(cid:147)I understood, a drawer(cid:160)(cid:133)(cid:148)

But here I took pity on my visitor(cid:146)s suspense, and some perhaps on

my own growing curiosity.

(cid:147)There it is, sir,(cid:148) said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the

floor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.

He sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart:
I could hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and
his face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life and
reason.

(cid:147)Compose yourself,(cid:148) said I.
He  turned  a  dreadful  smile  to  me,  and  as  if  with  the  decision  of
despair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, he uttered
one loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified. And the next
moment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, (cid:147)Have
you a graduated glass?(cid:148) he asked.

I rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what

he asked.

He thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of
the red tincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which
was at first of a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted,
to  brighten  in  colour,  to  effervesce  audibly,  and  to  throw  off  small
fumes of vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition
ceased  and  the  compound  changed  to  a  dark  purple,  which  faded
again  more  slowly  to  a  watery  green.  My  visitor,  who  had  watched
these metamorphoses with a keen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon
the table, and then turned and looked upon me with an air of scru-
tiny.

DR. LANYON(cid:146)S NARRATIVE

47

(cid:147)And now,(cid:148) said he, (cid:147)to settle what remains. Will you be wise? will
you be guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to
go forth from your house without further parley? or has the greed of
curiosity too much command of you?  Think before you answer, for it
shall be done as you decide.  As you decide, you shall be left as you
were before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service
rendered  to  a  man  in  mortal  distress  may  be  counted  as  a  kind  of
riches of the soul. Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province
of knowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open
to you, here, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be
blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.(cid:148)

(cid:147)Sir,(cid:148) said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly possessing,
(cid:147)you speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that I hear you
with no very strong impression of belief.  But I have gone too far in
the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end.(cid:148)

(cid:147)It is well,(cid:148) replied my visitor. (cid:147)Lanyon, you remember your vows:
what follows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who
have so long been bound to the most narrow and material views, you
who have denied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have
derided  your  superiors(cid:151)behold!(cid:148)

He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; he
reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with in-
jected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I
thought, a change(cid:151)he seemed to swell(cid:151)his face became suddenly black
and  the  features  seemed  to  melt  and  alter(cid:151)and  the  next  moment,  I
had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised
to shield me from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.

(cid:147)O God!(cid:148) I screamed, and (cid:147)O God!(cid:148) again and again; for there be-
fore my eyes(cid:151)pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before
him with his hands, like a man restored from death(cid:151)there stood Henry
Jekyll!

What he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on
paper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at
it; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if
I believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots; sleep
has left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the day and
night; and I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must die; and

48

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that man un-
veiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I can not, even in memory,
dwell on it without a start of horror. I will say but one thing, Utterson,
and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it) will be more than
enough.  The  creature  who  crept  into  my  house  that  night  was,  on
Jekyll(cid:146)s own confession, known by the name of Hyde and hunted for
in every corner of the land as the murderer of Carew.

HASTIE  LANYON

HENRY JEKYLL(cid:146)S FULL
STATEMENT OF THE CASE

I  WAS born in the year 18(cid:151) to a large fortune, endowed besides with
excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of
the wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been
supposed, with every guarantee of an honorurable and distinguished
future.  And  indeed  the  worst  of  my  faults  was  a  certain  impatient
gaiety  of  disposition,  such  as  has  made  the  happiness  of  many,  but
such as I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry
my  head  high,  and  wear  a  more  than  commonly  grave  countenance
before the public. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures;
and that when I reached years of reflection, and began to look round
me and take stock of my progress and position in the world, I stood
already committed to a profound duplicity of me. Many a man would
have even blazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the
high views that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an
almost morbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature
of  my  aspirations  than  any  particular  degradation  in  my  faults,  that
made me what I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the ma-
jority  of  men,  severed  in  me  those  provinces  of  good  and  ill  which
divide and compound man(cid:146)s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to
reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at
the root of religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress.
Though so profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite;
both sides of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I
laid aside restraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in
the eye of day, at the futherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow
and suffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific stud-
ies, which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, re-
acted and shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial
war among my members. With every day, and from both sides of my
intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer
to that truth, by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a
dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two,

50

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

because  the  state  of  my  own  knowledge  does  not  pass  beyond  that
point. Others will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines;
and I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere
polity of multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for
my part, from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direc-
tion and in one direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my
own  person,  that  I  learned  to  recognise  the  thorough  and  primitive
duality of man; I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the
field of my consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it
was  only  because  I  was  radically  both;  and  from  an  early  date,  even
before the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the
most naked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with
pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of
these  elements.  If  each,  I  told  myself,  could  be  housed  in  separate
identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust
might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his
more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on
his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his pleas-
ure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of
this extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that these incongru-
ous faggots were thus bound together(cid:151)that in the agonised womb of
consciousness,  these  polar  twins  should  be  continuously  struggling.
How, then were they dissociated?

I was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began
to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to per-
ceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling im-
materiality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body in
which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to
shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss
the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter deeply
into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I have been
made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound for ever
on man(cid:146)s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it off, it but
returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure. Sec-
ond, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too evident, my discover-
ies were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only recognised my natu-
ral body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the powers

HENRY JEKYLL(cid:146)S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE

51

that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by which
these  powers  should  be  dethroned  from  their  supremacy,  and  a  sec-
ond form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me
because  they  were  the  expression,  and  bore  the  stamp  of  lower  ele-
ments in my soul.

I  hesitated  long  before  I  put  this  theory  to  the  test  of  practice.  I
knew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled
and shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of
an  overdose  or  at  the  least  inopportunity  in  the  moment  of  exhibi-
tion, utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to
change. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at
last overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my
tincture;  I  purchased  at  once,  from  a  firm  of  wholesale  chemists,  a
large quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments,
to be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I com-
pounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the
glass,  and  when  the  ebullition  had  subsided,  with  a  strong  glow  of
courage, drank off the potion.

The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly
nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour
of birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I
came to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something strange
in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its very nov-
elty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in body; within I
was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of disordered sensual
images running like a millrace in my fancy, a solution of the bonds of
obligation, an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul. I
knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked,
tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my original evil; and the thought,
in that moment, braced and delighted me like wine. I stretched out
my hands, exulting in the freshness of these sensations; and in the act,
I was suddenly aware that I had lost in stature.

There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands
beside me as I write, was brought there later on and for the very pur-
pose of these transformations. The night however, was far gone into
the  morning(cid:151)the  morning,  black  as  it  was,  was  nearly  ripe  for  the
conception  of  the  day(cid:151)the  inmates  of  my  house  were  locked  in  the

52

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

most rigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was
with hope and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my
bedroom. I crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down
upon me, I could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that
sort that their unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole
through the corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my
room, I saw for the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.

I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but
that which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature,
to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust
and less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in
the course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of
effort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much
less exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde
was so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as
good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly
and plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still
believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint
of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in
the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of wel-
come. This, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes
it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and single,
than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto ac-
customed  to  call  mine.  And  in  so  far  I  was  doubtless  right.  I  have
observed that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could
come near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This,
as I take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are com-
mingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of
mankind, was pure evil.

I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive
experiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had
lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from
a house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I
once more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs
of dissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the
stature and the face of Henry Jekyll. That night I had come to the fatal
cross-roads.  Had  I  approached  my  discovery  in  a  more  noble  spirit,

HENRY JEKYLL(cid:146)S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE

53

had  I  risked  the  experiment  while  under  the  empire  of  generous  or
pious aspirations, all must have been otherwise, and from these ago-
nies of death and birth, I had come forth an angel instead of a fiend.
The drug had no discriminating action; it was neither diabolical nor
divine; it but shook the doors of the prisonhouse of my disposition;
and like the captives of Philippi, that which stood within ran forth. At
that time my virtue slumbered; my evil, kept awake by ambition, was
alert and swift to seize the occasion; and the thing that was projected
was Edward Hyde. Hence, although I had now two characters as well
as two appearances, one was wholly evil, and the other was still the old
Henry Jekyll, that incongruous compound of whose reformation and
improvement  I  had  already  learned  to  despair.  The  movement  was
thus wholly toward the worse.

Even at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness
of a life of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my
pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well
known and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man,
this incoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was
on this side that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had
but to drink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor,
and to assume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at the
notion; it seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made my
preparations with the most studious care. I took and furnished that
house in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged
as a housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and unscru-
pulous.  On  the  other  side,  I  announced  to  my  servants  that  a  Mr.
Hyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my
house  in  the  square;  and  to  parry  mishaps,  I  even  called  and  made
myself a familiar object, in my second character. I next drew up that
will to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in
the person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without
pecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I be-
gan to profit by the strange immunities of my position.

Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their
own person and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever
did so for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the public eye
with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy,

54

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

strip  off  these  lendings  and  spring  headlong  into  the  sea  of  liberty.
But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safely was complete. Think
of it(cid:151)I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my laboratory door,
give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the draught that I had
always standing ready; and whatever he had done, Edward Hyde would
pass  away  like  the  stain  of  breath  upon  a  mirror;  and  there  in  his
stead,  quietly  at  home,  trimming  the  midnight  lamp  in  his  study,  a
man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry Jekyll.
The pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I
have said, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the
hands  of  Edward  Hyde,  they  soon  began  to  turn  toward  the  mon-
strous. When I would come back from these excursions, I was often
plunged into a kind of wonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar
that I called out of my own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good
pleasure, was a being inherently malign and villainous; his every act
and  thought  centered  on  self;  drinking  pleasure  with  bestial  avidity
from any degree of torture to another; relentless like a man of stone.
Henry Jekyll stood at times aghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but
the situation was apart from ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the
grasp of conscience. It was Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was
guilty. Jekyll was no worse; he woke again to his good qualities seem-
ingly unimpaired; he would even make haste, where it was possible, to
undo the evil done by Hyde. And thus his conscience slumbered.

Into  the  details  of  the  infamy  at  which  I  thus  connived  (for  even
now I can scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of enter-
ing;  I  mean  but  to  point  out  the  warnings  and  the  successive  steps
with  which  my  chastisement  approached.  I  met  with  one  accident
which, as it brought on no consequence, I shall no more than men-
tion.  An  act  of  cruelty  to  a  child  aroused  against  me  the  anger  of  a
passer-by, whom I recognised the other day in the person of your kins-
man;  the  doctor  and  the  child(cid:146)s  family  joined  him;  there  were  mo-
ments when I feared for my life; and at last, in order to pacify their too
just resentment, Edward Hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay
them in a cheque drawn in the name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger
was easily eliminated from the future, by opening an account at an-
other bank in the name of Edward Hyde himself; and when, by slop-
ing my own hand backward, I had supplied my double with a signa-

HENRY JEKYLL(cid:146)S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE

55

ture, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.

Some two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out
for one of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the
next day in bed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked
about me; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of
my room in the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed
curtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept
insisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I
seemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed
to sleep in the body of Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in my
psychological  way,  began  lazily  to  inquire  into  the  elements  of  this
illusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a comfort-
able morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of my more
wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of Henry
Jekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size:
it was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which I now saw,
clearly  enough,  in  the  yellow  light  of  a  mid-London  morning,  lying
half shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corder, knuckly, of a dusky pal-
lor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. It was the hand of
Edward Hyde.

I must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in
the mere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as
sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my
bed I rushed to the mirror. At the sight that met my eyes, my blood
was changed into something exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone
to bed Henry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde. How was this to
be explained? I asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror(cid:151)
how was it to be remedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants
were up; all my drugs were in the cabinet(cid:151)a long journey down two
pairs  of  stairs,  through  the  back  passage,  across  the  open  court  and
through the anatomical theatre, from where I was then standing hor-
ror-struck. It might indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what
use was that, when I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stat-
ure?

And  then  with  an  overpowering  sweetness  of  relief,  it  came  back
upon my mind that the servants were already used to the coming and
going of my second self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in

56

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

clothes  of  my  own  size:  had  soon  passed  through  the  house,  where
Bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour
and in such a strange array; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had re-
turned to his own shape and was sitting down, with a darkened brow,
to make a feint of breakfasting.

Small  indeed  was  my  appetite.  This  inexplicable  incident,  this  re-
versal of my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger
on the wall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began
to reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibili-
ties of my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of
projecting,  had  lately  been  much  exercised  and  nourished;  it  had
seemed to me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown
in stature, as though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a
more generous tide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this
were much prolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently
overthrown, the power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the char-
acter  of  Edward  Hyde  become  irrevocably  mine.  The  power  of  the
drug  had  not  been  always  equally  displayed.  Once,  very  early  in  my
career, it had totally failed me; since then I had been obliged on more
than one occasion to double, and once, with infinite risk of death, to
treble the amount; and these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the
sole shadow on my contentment. Now, however, and in the light of
that morning(cid:146)s accident, I was led to remark that whereas, in the be-
ginning, the difficulty had been to throw off the body of Jekyll, it had
of late gradually but decidedly transferred itself to the other side. All
things therefore seemed to point to this; that I was slowly losing hold
of my original and better self, and becoming slowly incorporated with
my second and worse.

Between these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had
memory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared
between them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensi-
tive apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in
the  pleasures  and  adventures  of  Hyde;  but  Hyde  was  indifferent  to
Jekyll,  or  but  remembered  him  as  the  mountain  bandit  remembers
the cavern in which he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more
than a father(cid:146)s interest; Hyde had more than a son(cid:146)s indifference. To
cast in my lot with Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had

HENRY JEKYLL(cid:146)S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE

57

long secretly indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in
with Hyde, was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to
become, at a blow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain
might  appear  unequal;  but  there  was  still  another  consideration  in
the scales; for while Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of absti-
nence, Hyde would be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange
as  my  circumstances  were,  the  terms  of  this  debate  are  as  old  and
commonplace as man; much the same inducements and alarms cast
the die for any tempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me,
as it falls with so vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better
part and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it.

Yes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by
friends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to
the  liberty,  the  comparative  youth,  the  light  step,  leaping  impulses
and  secret  pleasures,  that  I  had  enjoyed  in  the  disguise  of  Hyde.  I
made  this  choice  perhaps  with  some  unconscious  reservation,  for  I
neither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward
Hyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I
was  true  to  my  determination;  for  two  months,  I  led  a  life  of  such
severity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the compensa-
tions of an approving conscience. But time began at last to obliterate
the  freshness  of  my  alarm;  the  praises  of  conscience  began  to  grow
into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and longings,
as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour of moral
weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the transforming
draught.

I do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon
his vice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers
that he runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I,
long as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the
complete  moral  insensibility  and  insensate  readiness  to  evil,  which
were the leading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I
was punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I
was conscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a
more furious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that
stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to
the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God, no

58

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful
a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that
in  which  a  sick  child  may  break  a  plaything.  But  I  had  voluntarily
stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst
of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among tempta-
tions; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was to fall.

Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport
of glee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow;
and  it  was  not  till  weariness  had  begun  to  succeed,  that  I  was  sud-
denly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a cold
thrill of terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit; and fled
from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and trembling, my
lust  of  evil  gratified  and  stimulated,  my  love  of  life  screwed  to  the
topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make assurance dou-
bly  sure)  destroyed  my  papers;  thence  I  set  out  through  the  lamplit
streets,  in  the  same  divided  ecstasy  of  mind,  gloating  on  my  crime,
light-headedly  devising  others  in  the  future,  and  yet  still  hastening
and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger. Hyde had
a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he drank
it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not done
tearing  him,  before  Henry  Jekyll,  with  streaming  tears  of  gratitude
and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped hands
to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. I saw
my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood, when I
had walked with my father(cid:146)s hand, and through the self-denying toils
of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same sense
of  unreality,  at  the  damned  horrors  of  the  evening.  I  could  have
screamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the
crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed
against me; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniq-
uity stared into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die
away, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct
was solved. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not,
I was now confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I
rejoiced to think of it! with what willing humility I embraced anew the
restrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I locked the
door  by  which  I  had  so  often  gone  and  come,  and  ground  the  key

under my heel!

The next day, came the news that the murder had been overlooked,
that the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was
a man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been
a tragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have my
better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the scaf-
fold. Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an in-
stant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him.
I resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say
with  honesty  that  my  resolve  was  fruitful  of  some  good.  You  know
yourself how earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to
relieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that
the days passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly say
that I wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead that
I daily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my dual-
ity  of  purpose;  and  as  the  first  edge  of  my  penitence  wore  off,  the
lower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began
to  growl  for  licence.  Not  that  I  dreamed  of  resuscitating  Hyde;  the
bare  idea  of  that  would  startle  me  to  frenzy:  no,  it  was  in  my  own
person  that  I  was  once  more  tempted  to  trifle  with  my  conscience;
and  it  was  as  an  ordinary  secret  sinner  that  I  at  last  fell  before  the
assaults of temptation.

There  comes  an  end  to  all  things;  the  most  capacious  measure  is
filled at last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed
the  balance  of  my  soul.  And  yet  I  was  not  alarmed;  the  fall  seemed
natural, like a return to the old days before I had made my discovery.
It was a fine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had
melted, but cloudless overhead; and the Regent(cid:146)s Park was full of win-
ter  chirrupings  and  sweet  with  spring  odours.  I  sat  in  the  sun  on  a
bench; the animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spir-
itual  side  a  little  drowsed,  promising  subsequent  penitence,  but  not
yet moved to begin. After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and
then I smiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active
good-will  with  the  lazy  cruelty  of  their  neglect.  And  at  the  very  mo-
ment of that vainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid
nausea and the most deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left
me  faint;  and  then  as  in  its  turn  faintness  subsided,  I  began  to  be

60

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

aware of a change in the temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a
contempt of danger, a solution of the bonds of obligation. I looked
down; my clothes hung formlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand
that lay on my knee was corded and hairy. I was once more Edward
Hyde. A moment before I had been safe of all men(cid:146)s respect, wealthy,
beloved(cid:151)the cloth laying for me in the dining-room at home; and now
I  was  the  common  quarry  of  mankind,  hunted,  houseless,  a  known
murderer, thrall to the gallows.

My reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more than
once observed that in my second character, my faculties seemed sharp-
ened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came about
that,  where  Jekyll  perhaps  might  have  succumbed,  Hyde  rose  to  the
importance of the moment. My drugs were in one of the presses of my
cabinet; how was I to reach them? That was the problem that (crush-
ing my temples in my hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door
I had closed. If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would
consign  me  to  the  gallows.  I  saw  I  must  employ  another  hand,  and
thought of Lanyon. How was he to be reached? how persuaded? Sup-
posing that I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way
into  his  presence?  and  how  should  I,  an  unknown  and  displeasing
visitor,  prevail  on  the  famous  physician  to  rifle  the  study  of  his  col-
league, Dr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that of my original character,
one part remained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had
conceived that kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted
up from end to end.

Thereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a
passing  hansom,  drove  to  an  hotel  in  Portland  Street,  the  name  of
which I chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed
comical  enough,  however  tragic  a  fate  these  garments  covered)  the
driver could not conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with
a gust of devilish fury; and the smile withered from his face(cid:151)happily
for him(cid:151)yet more happily for myself, for in another instant I had cer-
tainly dragged him from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked
about me with so black a countenance as made the attendants trem-
ble;  not  a  look  did  they  exchange  in  my  presence;  but  obsequiously
took  my  orders,  led  me  to  a  private  room,  and  brought  me  where-
withal to write. Hyde in danger of his life was a creature new to me;

HENRY JEKYLL(cid:146)S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE

61

shaken with inordinate anger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting
to  inflict  pain.  Yet  the  creature was  astute;  mastered  his  fury  with  a
great  effort  of  the  will;  composed  his  two  important  letters,  one  to
Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he might receive actual evidence of
their being posted, sent them out with directions that they should be
registered.  Thenceforward,  he  sat  all  day over  the  fire  in  the  private
room, gnawing his nails; there he dined, sitting alone with his fears,
the waiter visibly quailing before his eye; and thence, when the night
was  fully  come,  he  set  forth  in  the  corner  of  a  closed  cab,  and  was
driven to and fro about the streets of the city. He, I say(cid:151)I cannot say, I.
That child of Hell had nothing human; nothing lived in him but fear
and hatred. And when at last, thinking the driver had begun to grow
suspicious, he discharged the cab and ventured on foot, attired in his
misfitting clothes, an object marked out for observation, into the midst
of  the  nocturnal    passengers,  these  two  base  passions  raged  within
him like a tempest. He walked fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to
himself,  skulking  through  the  less  frequented  thoroughfares,  count-
ing the minutes that still divided him from midnight. Once a woman
spoke to him, offering, I think, a box of lights. He smote her in the
face, and she fled.

When  I  came  to  myself  at  Lanyon(cid:146)s,  the  horror  of  my  old  friend
perhaps  affected  me  somewhat:  I  do  not  know;  it  was  at  least  but  a
drop  in  the  sea  to  the  abhorrence  with  which  I  looked  back  upon
these hours. A change had come over me. It was no longer the fear of
the gallows, it was the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received
Lanyon(cid:146)s  condemnation  partly  in  a  dream;  it  was  partly  in  a  dream
that I came home to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the
prostration of the day, with a stringent and profound slumber which
not even the nightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke
in  the  morning  shaken,  weakened,  but  refreshed.  I  still  hated  and
feared the thought of the brute that slept within me, and I had not of
course  forgotten  the  appalling  dangers  of  the  day  before;  but  I  was
once  more  at  home,  in  my  own  house  and  close  to  my  drugs;  and
gratitude for my escape shone so strong in my soul that it almost ri-
valled the brightness of hope.

I was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the
chill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those inde-

62

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

scribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the time
to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging and
freezing with the passions of Hyde. It took on this occasion a double
dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat looking
sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be re-admin-
istered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a great effort as
of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation of the drug,
that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all hours of the
day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory shudder; above
all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it was always as
Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this continually impending
doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now condemned myself, ay,
even  beyond  what  I  had  thought  possible  to  man,  I  became,  in  my
own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak
both  in  body  and  mind,  and  solely  occupied  by  one  thought:    the
horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when the virtue of the
medicine  wore  off,  I  would  leap  almost  without  transition  (for  the
pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the possession of
a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling with causeless
hatreds,  and  a  body  that  seemed  not  strong  enough  to  contain  the
raging  energies  of  life.  The  powers  of  Hyde  seemed  to  have  grown
with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate that now divided
them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was a thing of vital in-
stinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creature that shared
with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was co-heir
with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which in
themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought of
Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish but
inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit seemed
to  utter  cries  and  voices;  that  the  amorphous  dust  gesticulated  and
sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the of-
fices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to him
closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh, where he
heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every hour of
weakness,  and  in  the  confidence  of  slumber,  prevailed  against  him,
and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of a
different order. His terror of the gallows drove him continually to com-

HENRY JEKYLL(cid:146)S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE

63

mit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a part
instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the de-
spondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented the dis-
like with which he was himself regarded. Hence the ape-like tricks that
he would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the pages
of  my  books,  burning  the  letters  and  destroying  the  portrait  of  my
father;  and  indeed,  had  it  not  been  for  his  fear  of  death,  he  would
long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin.  But
his love of me is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at
the mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of
this attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him
off by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him.

It is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this descrip-
tion; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice; and yet
even  to  these,  habit  brought(cid:151)no,  not  alleviation(cid:151)but  a  certain  cal-
lousness  of  soul,  a  certain  acquiescence  of  despair;  and  my  punish-
ment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity which has
now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face and
nature. My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed since
the date of the first experiment, began to run low. I sent out for a fresh
supply and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and the first
change of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was without effi-
ciency. You will learn from Poole how I have had London ransacked;
it was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supply was im-
pure, and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy to the
draught.

About  a  week  has  passed,  and  I  am  now  finishing  this  statement
under the influence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the
last  time,  short  of  a  miracle,  that  Henry  Jekyll  can  think  his  own
thoughts or see his own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor
must I delay too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative
has  hitherto  escaped  destruction,  it  has  been  by  a  combination  of
great prudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take
me in the act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time
shall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness and
circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from
the action of his ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE

on us both has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from
now, when I shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I
know  how  I  shall  sit  shuddering  and  weeping  in  my  chair,  or  con-
tinue,  with  the  most  strained  and  fearstruck  ecstasy  of  listening,  to
pace up and down this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to
every sound of menace. Will Hyde die upon the scaffold? or will he
find courage to release himself at the last moment? God knows; I am
careless; this is my true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns
another than myself. Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to
seal up my confession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to
an end.
