One user can have multiple orders, but each order belongs to only one user. This relationship is established through the `user_id` foreign key in the `orders` table.\n\n**Data Types and Constraints:**\n\n* **`INT UNSIGNED`:** Integer values (positive whole numbers)\n* **`VARCHAR(255)`:** Variable-length string (up to 255 characters)\n* **`BOOLEAN`:** True/false values\n* **`TIMESTAMP`:** Stores date and time information\n* **`DECIMAL(10, 2)`:** Decimal values with a precision of 10 digits and a scale of 2 (e.g., 12345678.90)\n* **`PRIMARY KEY`:** Uniquely identifies each row in a table\n* **`AUTO_INCREMENT`:** Automatically generates the next sequential value for the primary key\n* **`NOT NULL`:** Ensures that a column cannot have a null value\n* **`UNIQUE`:** Ensures that all values in a column are unique\n* **`FOREIGN KEY`:** Establishes a link between two tables based on a common column (enforces referential integrity)\n\n\nUser request:\n\nEloquent.query(\"I need a list of all active users who have spent more than $100 in the last month.
